## SITE MONITORING PROGRAM
This Program demonstrates how we can monitor the availability of sites and services using Go.

### How to run the program?
To run the program, you just have to simply run the main.go file using `go run main.go` OR `./main_binary`

`main_binary` is the binary of main.go file. It can be re-generated using `go build -o main_binary main.go`
